		I was born in New Orleans in 1999, and moved to Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, where my family still resides. I currently attend Texas A&M University, where I am studying Computer Science with an Economics minor. <br><br> For fun, I like to learn languages & study linguistics, using Duolingo or reading international news, and have learned to speak Swedish conversationally, as well as some French and Spanish. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39027389-babel">Here's</a> my favorite book on language). I also like to study finance (investing) and economics (development, behavioral).
