		I am grateful to have had several opportunities to intern over the past few years with great companies and I am very fortunate to be spending my next summer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html">Deloitte</a> doing technology consulting. Below are some major points; please connect with me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-campbell-hinrichs-aa7652147/">LinkedIn</a> and see my <a target="_blank" href="resume.pdf">resume</a> for more information about my work and service experience. I look forward to being in touch!<br><br>

		<u><b><i>BP, p.l.c. (NYSE: BP); Numeric Algorithms Group - Summer 2019<br></u>High Performance Computing Intern<br></i></b>
			I spent my last summer with<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nag.com/"> Numerial Algorithms Group </a>working at BP's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bp.com/en_us/united-states/home/who-we-are/technology/center-for-high-performance-computing.html">Center for High Performance Computing</a> in Houston, TX. I had two major projects over the course of my twelve-week internship. In the first, I did <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)">benchmarking</a> to work toward improving our job-submission protocol on two clusters. In my second project, I used <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fusepy/fusepy">fusepy</a> to create a virtual filesystem to parallelize geophysical data processing. Additionally, I attended and completed Rice University's week-long <a target="_blank" href="http://bootcamp.rice.edu/hpc-bootcamp/">High Perofrmance Computing Boot Camp</a>, which focused on practical supercomputing in a business context.<br>

		<br><u><b><i>Big Data Energy Services - Summer 2018<br></u>Computer Science Intern<br></i></b>

			After my Freshman year, I worked at <a target="_blank"href="https://www.bigdataenergy.com">Big Data Energy Services</a> in Houston, TX. BDE provides EDI transactional services, digital asset management, and data solutions to clients with large automation. I used <a target="_blank"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation"> Robot Process Automation </a> to help automate an internal server audit process, and did <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.kali.org/">penetration testing in Kali Linux</a> to test network security.<br>

			Upon graduating from high school, I began my first job at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rig.net/">RigNet</a> (whose link is an aptly named rig.net) in Houston, TX. RigNet provides technology solutions, mainly remote network infrastructure, in oil & gas, maritime, and government settings. During my internship, I learned about offshore oil rig cybersecurity risk assessment, using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">NIST</a> framework. Additionally, I learned business fundamentals, such as global operation organization, and had the chance to work with the global engineering team to organize a network database.
